# Should/Can we do this?

- Testing UI is hard because its usually not fully defined until launch
- Test business-critical functionality
- Realistic use cases:
    - We inherit a code base from a client and are tasked with maintenance + new features
    - We develop a new site with business-critical transactions (forms)
    - We have a brittle piece of software that breaks often during maintenance.
